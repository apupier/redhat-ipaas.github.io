## File Structure
We use the component approach in our starter. This is the new standard for developing Angular apps and a great way to ensure maintainable code by encapsulation of our behavior logic. A component is basically a self contained app, usually in a single file or a folder with each concern as a file: style, template, specs, e2e, and component class.

# Getting Started
## Dependencies
What you need to run this app:

- `node` and `npm` (`brew install node` for OS X users)
- Ensure you're running the latest versions Node `v6.x.x`+ and NPM `3.x.x`+

## Installing
* `fork` the ipaas repo
* `clone` your fork
* `npm install` to install all dependencies
* `npm start` to start the dev server

## Running
After you have installed all dependencies you can now run the app. Run `npm start` to start a local server using `webpack-dev-server` which will watch, build (in-memory), and reload for you. The port will be displayed to you as `http://0.0.0.0:9000` (or if you prefer IPv6, if you're using `express` server, then it's `http://[::1]:9000/`).

### Development
```bash
$ npm start
```

### Production
```
$ npm run build:prod
$ npm run server:prod
```

For a list of common commands, see [here](https://github.com/redhat-ipaas/ipaas-client/blob/master/docs/commands.md).

## Testing

### Run Tests
```
npm run test
```

### Watch and Run Tests
```
npm run watch:test
```

For a list of common commands, see [here](https://github.com/redhat-ipaas/ipaas-client/blob/master/docs/commands.md).

## Configuring
Configuration files live in `/config`. Configuration files are currently available for Webpack, Karma, and Protractor.
